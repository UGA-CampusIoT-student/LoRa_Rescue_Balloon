**About**

This folder contains a [Processing](https://processing.org/) sketch that takes in roll and pitch values from a serial port in comma separated value (CSV) format, and tilts a 3D model accordingly.

**Requriements**

 - Processing (tested on v3.3.6)
 - Python Mode for Processing

**Setup**

Once you have Processing with python mode installed, you will need to open this sketch and change the SERIAL_DEVICE variable to match the serial port of your device. Once you have done this just run the sketch and a 3D model should appear that tilts with the board.
